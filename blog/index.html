<h1>Development is underway for 2022.04.14</h1>
<p>Development has gone underway for the next packaged .iso of Rolling Rhino Remix! This release won't just be a newly compiled disk image with the latest updates. We are aiming to release a new update to the Rhino utility by the time we have released 2022.04.14. The new feature, rhino-config will at first only support the option to configure whether you would prefer to use the mainline Linux kernel or stick with the current Ubuntu kernel with all of their optimisations however support will be extended in the future to allow for the installation of proprietary drivers and other features too.</p>
<p>This release has been delayed by an extra couple of days for two various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to conflicting schedules in personal lives we have had to delay the release, as preparing for a release takes a lot of work.</li>
<li>We are aiming to release rhino-config in this release and we are determined to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the new rhino-config utility is not available by this release we will keep you updated, however we hope that we have allowed ourselves enough time to create this feature and test it extensively before release. Every release will subsequently be released bi-weekly on a Thursday unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Other changes in this future release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Us trialing a more automated process for .iso creation using a bash script, which will allow us more time to work on other features of the distribution, such as Rhino</li>
<li>Having the new disk images have the latest updates so users are not required to update a lot of packages upon installation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Release 2022.03.26</h1>
<p>Rolling Rhino Remix has had its first official public release! Ubuntu is now (unofficially) provided as a rolling release distribution! You are able to download the .iso file for the distribution <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/download">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What's new?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All packages have been updated to their latest versions in the Ubuntu repository</li>
<li>The <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-rhino">rhino</a> utility tool has been created and packaged in the distribution. Rhino is used as a drop-in replacement for <code>apt update</code> and <code>apt upgrade</code> and allows for the initialisation of the distribution upon first installation. To learn more please read the <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-rhino">rhino documentation</a> and our <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-quickstart">Quick Start guide</a>.</li>
<li>We have replaced the default background with our own background image featuring our mascot, a rhino! You are able to download the background image <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/assets/images/background.png">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore Rolling Rhino is now fully open source upon its first release, if you for any reason decide to create your own disk image rather than use the ones we have created, you can. Just read our documentation and follow the steps provided <a href="rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-create">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of our contributors who have made our first release possible! You are able to view the full list of contributors <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/contributors.txt">here</a>.</p>
