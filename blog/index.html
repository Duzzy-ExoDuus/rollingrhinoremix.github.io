                    <h1>Changes to our brand</h1>
                    <p>Rolling Rhino Remix has gone through a major brand redesign before the next release. This includes brand new logos, new wallpapers and a brand-new website.</p>
                    <p>We believe that a good brand is essential for any project. Logos should be instantly recognisable and visisble when small, and websites should be unique and readable. We have undergone major design changes to bring the best possible experience to Rolling Rhino Remix. Everything evolves, and Rolling Rhino Remix is no different, going through three website and brand design changes since the beginning of the project, however we have now created a brand identity which we believe encapsulates what Rolling Rhino Remix is about, while being unique and sticking to our Ubuntu roots.</p>
                    <p>We have now established a set of brand guidelines which you can view <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/branding">here</a>. Our set of Brand Guidelines exist so that Rolling Rhino Remix is communicated with the same precision we used to create it.</p>
                    <p>We hope you enjoy these new changes to Rolling Rhino Remix, and our brand.</p>

                    <h1>Development is underway for 2022.05.03!</h1>
                    <p>Development has begun for the next disk image release. A lot of small changes are going into this release to create the best possible user experience. The newly packaged rhino-config v2.0 binaries will be provided by default, along with a set of brand-new wallpapers. At the moment we are unsure whether the default wallpaper will change, but some alternatives will be provided in <code>/usr/share/backgrounds/rolling-backgrounds</code>. Other small changes such as the rest of the <code>config-v2</code> update that was pushed to rhino-update will also be provided by default, and all packages will be updated to their latest versions.</p>
                    <p>This is the first disk image that will be built ontop of the released Jammy disk image, and so when you switch to the devel series with <code>rhino-init</code>, it will prompt an error similar to <code>E: expected Jammy but got Kinetic.</code>, This can be rectified by hitting “y” (for yes) to switch the devel series to track Kinetic. Your system will still be Rolling, it justs means that the development branch is now tracking the upcoming Ubuntu release.</p>
                    <hr />
                </div>

                <div id="config-v2">
                    <h1>rhino-config v2.0 & rhino-update v1.2.1</h1>
                    <p>After a couple of weeks of development, rhino-config v2.0 has been completed. We have completely turned rhino-config into a command-line utility, written in Rust, with the help of our new maintainer, Wizard28. This means that support for the legacy python script will be dropping.</p>
                    <p>From now on, in order to be able to use rhino-config you must first update your system to pull the latest Rust binary from our repository. To do this, type <code>rhino-update</code> in your terminal. The full documentation for rhino-config has been updated and can be found <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/docs-rhino-config">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>&bull; If you would still like an interactive script, similar to the way that rhino-config was in version v1.2, you can run <code>rhino-config enable --interactive</code> to have it walk you through the options.</p>
                    <p>rhino-update has recieved a minor update, which will now download and install the latest rust binary for rhino-config. Along with this it now will install kernel 5.17.4 as opposed to 5.17.3. In order to ensure that updates are ran smoother, the .bashrc file will be replaced and all of our Rhino aliases will be moved to ~/.bash_aliases, so that we can update the bash aliases without any disruptive change to the system.</p>
                    <h2>Legacy rhino-config script</h2>
                    <p>The legacy rhino-config python script will still be available until the next disk image release, so that users who have not yet ran rhino-update will not recieve any major breaking changes. The script will officially be deprecated as of 2022.05.03, and will automatically upgrade the user if they have not done so already. it is recommended that you run <code>rhino-update</code> to recieve the latest change as soon as possible.</p>

                    <h1>Pacstall integration - rhino-update & rhino-config v1.2</h1>
                    <p>The Rolling Rhino Remix development team has worked closely with the development team of <a href="https://pacstall.dev">Pacstall</a> to bring their software onto our distribution. Pacstall is an AUR-inspired package manager for Ubuntu. It brings the experience of the Arch User Repository directly to Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based systems with an ever-growing number of user-maintained packages.</p>
                    <p>We have integrated, along with the help of the Pacstall development team, Pacstall directly into our Rhino utilities. Pacstall can now be enabled via <code>rhino-config</code> and all Pacstall applications can be updated via <code>rhino-update</code>.</p>
                    <p>In order to enable Pacstall onto your system please read our <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/docs-pacstall">Pacstall documentation</a>.</p>

                    <p>After almost 3 weeks of hard work we have released the latest packaged version of Rolling Rhino Remix.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What's new?</b> <br/>
                        &bull; All packages have been updated to their latest versions in the Ubuntu repositories. <br/>
                        &bull; The <a href="https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/rhino-config">rhino-config</a> utility has been created to extend the capabilities of rhino-update. <br/>
                        &bull; The <a href="https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/rhino-config">rhino-config</a> utility has the ability to purge and hold snapd from apt updates and install the mainline kernel. <br/>
                        &bull; Bug fixes. <br/>
                        &bull; Code refactoring <br/>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        &bull; Before you update it is important to note that a bug in 2022.03.26 requires manual intervention to fix otherwise the upgrade to the latest release will not work. In order to fix this bug click <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/blog#2022-03-26bug">here</a>.</li>

                    <h2>The future of Rolling Rhino Remix</h2>
                    <p>This has been known for a while but all discussion and development for Rolling Rhino Remix now happens on our Discord, which you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/JMu4SYRs2n">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>From this release onwards all of our utilities, such as rhino-config and rhino-update, will be updated irrsepective of disk image releases. Large-scale changes to the utilities will still recieve updates on our blog page. This will allow for users to get the latest and greatest changes to Rhino without any wait.</p>
                    <p>We have updated our website, it now uses server-side Jekyll to generate the pages rather than Eleventy being ran client-side then the generated pages being uploaded to GitHub. This will allow for people to make web-pages and fix our mistakes easier as they will be in pure Markdown as opposed to HTML.</p>
                    <p>The biggest change for the future of Rolling Rhino Remix is the integration of <a href="https://pacstall.dev">Pacstall</a>. We have worked along-side the developers of Pacstall to integrate their software into our Distribution. Pacstall provides a similar experience to the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a> on Ubuntu, and working along-side these developers to integrate it into our Distribution will mean that you will have a new way to install bleeding-edge software onto your system.</p>
                    <p>As always, thanks to everyone who has shown an interest in the project, and a special thank you to our <a href="https://rollingrhino.org">developers & contributors</a> who have helped improve the project.</p>

                <div id="2022-03-26bug">
                    <h1>Bug in 2022.03.26 - Requires manual intervention</h1>
                    <p>During the development cycle of 2022.04.14 I have noticed a bug that will affect currently existing versions of Rolling Rhino Remix (2022.03.26 is the only version released.), the bash alias that calls <code>rhino-update</code> runs the update.sh script as sudo, which has presented problems when we look for files in the user’s home directories. Luckily you are able to easily manually patch the system yourself.</p>
                    <p>The fix is fairly straightforward, all you will need is <code>git</code> and <code>mv</code>, both of which are provided in Rolling Rhino Remix</p>
                    <p>
                        To apply the fix, do the following: <br/>
                        &bull; cd ~ <br/>
                        &bull; git clone https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/distro <br/>
                        &bull; mv ~/distro/.bashrc ~ <br/>
                        &bull; mv ~/distro/.bash_aliases
                    </p>
                    <p>and there you go, the fix has been applied and you will continue getting updates from us. The next update, which releases with 2022.04.14, will work as intended if you have applied this patch.</p>

                <div id="development-update-1">
                    <h1>Development underway for 2022.04.14!</h1>
                    <p>Development has gone underway for the next packaged .iso of Rolling Rhino Remix! This release won’t just be a newly compiled disk image with the latest updates. We are aiming to release a new update to the Rhino utility by the time we have released 2022.04.14. The new feature, rhino-config will at first only support the option to configure whether you would prefer to use the mainline Linux kernel or stick with the current Ubuntu kernel with all of their optimisations however support will be extended in the future to allow for the installation of proprietary drivers and other features too.</p>
                    <p>
                        This release has been delayed by an extra couple of days for two various reasons: <br/>
                        &bull; Due to conflicting schedules in personal lives we have had to delay the release, as preparing for a release takes a lot of work. <br/>
                        &bull; We are aiming to release rhino-config in this release and we are determined to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other changes in this future release include: <br/>
                        &bull; Us trialing a more automated process for .iso creation using a bash script, which will allow us more time to work on other features of the distribution, such as Rhino <br/>
                        &bull; Having the new disk images have the latest updates so users are not required to update a lot of packages upon installation.
