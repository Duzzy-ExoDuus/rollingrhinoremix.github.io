# Rolling Rhino Remix - rhino-init Documentation

The command rhino-init, will initialise Rolling Rhino Remix. It will replace `/etc/apt/sources.list` with the Ubuntu devel repositories (as opposed to the next Ubuntu release).  Once it has completed this step it will automatically update all other packages via APT. After rhino-init has been completed you will not be required to utilise it again. It works as a bash alias in your ~/.bashrc file.

To run rhino init, just run `rhino-init` in your terminal.
