# Rolling Rhino Remix Website

https://rollingrhino.org

This is the official repository for the Rolling Rhino Remix. Rolling Rhino Remix is an un-official Ubuntu flavour which converts the Ubuntu operating system into a rolling release Linux distriibution by tracking the devel series. A rolling release distribution is a Linux distribution which receives continuous package updates, and as such there is no major update (unlike Ubuntu's current release model where there is clear progression between versions). A rolling release model offers new and experienced users a new way to utilise their desktop PC, without the hassle of major upgrades.
