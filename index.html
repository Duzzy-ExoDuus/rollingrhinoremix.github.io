        <h1>Rolling Rhino Remix is officially End of Life.</h1>
        <p>
            In October 2022 I wrote a <a href="rolling-forward.html">blog post</a> detailing that Rolling Rhino Remix would no longer be reciving any further development, in favour of its successor project, <a href="https://rhinolinux.org" target="_blank">Rhino Linux</a>. A lot of development has happened since then, and I am proud to announce that Rhino Linux is ready to be released soon!
            <br><br>
            Rhino Linux will still be a rolling release distribution based on Ubuntu. It's main advantages have already been announced, such as the AUR-like package manager: Pacstall, the rhino-pkg package manager wrapper, and more. A new development is that it will feature our own heavily-customised XFCE-desktop environment, called Unicorn, which will combine the best things about many different desktop environments. It will have an App Grid, Virtual desktops dashboard, uLauncher and much more.
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately this means Rolling Rhino Remix is officially end of life. That means that from here on out, it will recieve no major or minor developments, and we will be in the process of archiving the repositories.
            <br><br>
            The next course of action, if you are still on Rolling Rhino Remix would be to install Rhino Linux. We are currently in open beta as of the 12th May 2023, and have had users report a relatively stable experience. You will be able to update from the beta to the release version with a simple update.

            I would like to thank everyone who has supported the development of Rolling Rhino Remix, and those that will continue to support us at Rhino Linux. It has been an honour working on this project, and I can't wait to keep providing with Rhino Linux.
            <br> - Sincerely, AJStrong - Project Lead for Rhino Linux and Rolling Rhino Remix
