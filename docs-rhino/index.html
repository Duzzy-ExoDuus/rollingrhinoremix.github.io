<h1>Rolling Rhino Remix - Rhino Documentation</h1>
<p>Rhino is a command-line utility specifically created for Rolling Rhino Remix. There are currently two functions that Rhino can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>rhino-init</li>
<li>rhino-update</li>
</ul>
<p>The first command, rhino-init, will initialise Rolling Rhino Remix. It will replace <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with the Ubuntu devel repositories (as opposed to the next Ubuntu release).  Once it has completed this step it will automatically update all other packages via APT. After rhino-init has been completed you will not be required to utilise it again.</p>
<p>The second command, rhino-update, will be the command that you will use to update your system. It will update your system via apt as well as provide the latest tools that we develop and the latest Linux kernel direct from the Ubuntu mainline repository. This tool was developed so that we are able to easily provide updates to the Rolling Rhino Remix desktop, as well as provide the latest Linux kernel binaries. It is recommended that you use this command as opposed to <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code> that is more common on standard Ubuntu desktops.</p>
