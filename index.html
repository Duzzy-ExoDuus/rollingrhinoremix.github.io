<h1>Rolling Rhino Remix</h1>
<p>Rolling Rhino Remix is an un-official Ubuntu flavour which converts the Ubuntu operating system into a rolling release Linux distriibution by tracking the devel series. A rolling release distribution is a Linux distribution which recieves continuous package updates, and as such there is no major update (unlike Ubuntu's current release model where there is clear progression between versions). A rolling release model offers new and experienced users a new way to utilise their desktop PC, without the hassle of major upgrades.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Why use Rolling Rhino Remix?</h1>
<p>If you prefer the easy-to-use nature of Ubuntu but prefer the style of a rolling release from other distributions such as Arch Linux then Rolling Rhino Remix might be for you! We work hard to ensure that Rolling Rhino Remix has the best possible user experience. We have created tools and additional repositories to try to ensure that Ubuntu works smoothly as a Rolling Release distribution.</p>
<p>I have personally felt like Ubuntu should have always adopted the rolling release model rather than providing interim releases. Ubuntu would still be able to provide LTS releases for enterprise use and those who would prefer a point release distribution, and then the rolling release version could be provided as the recommended distribution for desktop users.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What new tools are included in the distribution?</h1>
<p>The main tool that we have created is <code>rhino-update</code>, it will ensure that system updates are ran smoothly, and extends the capabilities of what apt is able to provide. Since not all updates in the devel repository are bleeding-edge due to it being a development repository for future Ubuntu releases, we will be providing some software in our own repositories, such as the latest Linux Kernel.</p>
<hr />
<h1>How do I utilise the distribution?</h1>
<p>This is important to read as you will need to read the documentation in order to understand how the distribution functions and is fundamentally different to Ubuntu. You will need to go through some additional steps to get started such as initialising the distribution. Updating the distribution is also different compared to how you would on a standard Ubuntu desktop. It is recommended that you read our <a href="https://rollingrhinoremix.github.io/docs-quickstart">Quick Start Guide</a> in order to understand and utilise our distribution correctly.</p>
<hr />
<h1>How can I get involved with development?</h1>
<p>Pretty easily! The best way to get involved in development is to contribute via GitHub as well as join our mail list.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have taken the decision to do development communications through a mail list for a few reasons, such as:
<ul>
<li>Not everyone uses a specific platform, but a large majority of people will have access to email.</li>
<li>Email platforms are not typically resource intensive, so it allows for more people to get involved.</li>
<li>Emails are fairly easy to keep track of and manage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the steps you will have to take to join the mail list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email recipient: ubunturollingremix@gmail.com</li>
<li>Subject: REQ-Join-Mail-List</li>
<li>Body: REQ-Join-Mail-List
<ul>
<li><strong>Please ensure that the recipient, subject and body are all correct without any changes or modifications, any modifications may lead to your account not being added to the mail list and requiring a resubmission.</strong></li>
</ul>
