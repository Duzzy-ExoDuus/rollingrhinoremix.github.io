<h1>Ubuntu Rolling Remix - Bug Tracker</h1>
<ul>
<li>Please be aware that Ubuntu Rolling Remix is a rolling release distribution. Bugs are to be expected and it will not be perfectly stable. This is also amplified by the fact that Ubuntu is not a rolling release distribution by nature. While we will attempt to prevent bugs as much as possible there is no guarentee.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List of known bugs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issue performing rhino-upgrade with Nvidia hardware
<ul>
<li>There is currently a known issue where if you run rhino-upgrade on hardware with Nvidia your system will become unrecoverable. We are aware of this issue and are looking into ways to fix it. We currently believe this issue is due to an issue where the Nvidia driver does not work due to the fact that the Kernel has been upgraded to an unsupported version. We are looking into ways for fixing this before the next release. <strong>For now it is recommended to run <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade</code> as opposed to <code>rhino-upgrade</code></strong></li>
