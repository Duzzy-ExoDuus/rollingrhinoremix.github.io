                <h1>Rolling Rhino Remix - Quick Start Guide</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for Rolling Rhino Remix! Thank you for installing our Linux distribution. This distribution is the collective work of a few contributors.</p>
                <p>&bull; This guide assumes that you have already installed Rolling Rhino Remix, if you have not then please follow our <a href="../docs-install">Installation guide</a>.</p>
                <p>So firstly, congratulations on installing Rolling Rhino Remix! Each .iso image is created utilising an Ubuntu Daily Build, so you may already notice a few features that have not yet released in Ubuntu.</p>
                <p>The first step you will have to take once you have booted into your desktop is to open a terminal. Rolling Rhino Remix currently does not have any graphical means for updating and initalising the system. Once you have opened a terminal you will need to run the following command:</p>
                <p><code>rhino-init</code></p>
                <p>This will initialise Rolling Rhino Remix. It will replace <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> with the Ubuntu devel repositories (as opposed to the next Ubuntu release). Once it has completed this, it will automatically begin to update your system with the latest from the devel repositories. Once your system has updated please reboot to begin the next step. <b>You will not be required to run rhino-init again once you have completed this step.</b></p>
                <p>Once your system has been rebooted you will need to open a second terminal and run:</p>
                <p><code>rhino-update</code></p>
                <p>This command will be the command that you will use to update your system. It will update your system via apt as well as provide the latest tools that we develop and the latest Linux kernel direct from the Ubuntu mainline repository. This tool was developed so that we are able to easily provide updates to the Rolling Rhino Remix desktop, as well as provide the latest Linux kernel binaries. Once this has completed please reboot to begin utilising your system.</p>
                <p>Once you have done this you are able to utilise your system! It is recommended that you run <code>rhino-update</code> at least once per week so that you will not miss any crucial updates. Rolling Rhino Remix is able to be used just like any other Ubuntu system, the only difference is that you will need to use <code>rhino-update</code> to update. The installation and removal of applications <b>does not change</b> and is not supported by rhino, you will need to use APT or Snaps instead.</p>
                <p><em>If you wish to configure your updates using our `rhino-config` command, please refer to our <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/docs-rhino-config0">rhino-config documentation</a></em>.</p>
